          Come and experience the tranquility and limitless recreational
          possibilities of Folly Beach and Charleston. Conveniently located
          1/4 miles from Folly's shopping and dining as well as 1/2 mile
          from it's beautiful beaches and pier, our visitors enjoy the
          enviable 'best of both worlds' soaking up the sun in a relaxed,
          small beach community while being only 20 minutes from all that
          historic downtown Charleston has to offer with its historic tours,
          extensive shopping and world-class dining. Enjoy views from
          every vantage point of Folly River and salt marshes from our 3
          bedroom/3 bathroom condominium. With creature comforts in mind,
          our 1400 square foot condominium has been recently renovated,
          including new granite counters<!-- in the kitchen and new flooring
          throughout. It has been thoughtfully decorated to reflect the
          beauty, character and history of Folly Beach and the greater
          Charleston area, and this vacation home is complete with historic maps, antiques and photography to
          help visitors enjoy one of the prettiest spots in America. A large,
          screened porch accessed from the master bedroom and living area,
          provides views of South Carolina's egrets, herons, and
          spectacular sunsets. When returning from a long day at the beach,
          children will enjoy crabbing off our community's pier or swimming and
          sunbathing in the community pool. -->
